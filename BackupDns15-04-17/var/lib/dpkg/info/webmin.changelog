   the number of databases a Webmin user can own.
 * MySQL Database Server : Fields can now be specified as unsigned when
   creating a table.

   and group list display, which takes up less space on systems with

   would be overwritten when Webmin writes to the link filename (CVE
   bug CAN-2004-0559).
 * Webmin Core : When PAM is used for Unix authentication, expired passwords
   are now detected and the user is prompted to select a new password

   IP allocation ranges.

   and deleting slave zones, for use by remote callers to avoid transferring
   large amounts of data via RPC calls.

   a zone properly, the ndc command will be attempted as well if possible.
 * Printer Administration : Ported the module to AIX, to manage it's
   native /etc/qconfig file and driver system.

   to email in HTML format. Requires Java 1.4+ in the browser. Must be
   enabled on the Module Config page, as it is still rather unstable.

   email, configurable on the Module Config page.
 * System Time : Multiple time servers can now be entered to sync with.
 * LDAP Users and Groups : Updated the Module Config setting for password

   when using Shorewall, by adding them to the /etc/shorewall/start file.
 * Bandwidth Monitoring : The module now also supports the IPFilter firewall,

   for sites running multiple Samba instances or using a non-standard
   config file.
 * BSD Firewall : The firewall configuration can now be copied automatically
   to multiple hosts in a cluster, and will be applied on all hosts when
   the the Apply button is clicked. Like other cluster features in Webmin,
   this requires that the servers be first setup in the Webmin Servers
   Index module.
 * Cluster Software Packages : Packages can be installed from APT, YUM
   or other supported package systems on multiple hosts at once.
 * RBAC and Projects : First version of this module, which can manage
   user attributes, profiles, authorizations and the system policy. Currently
   only supports Solaris, which is the only OS that includes RBAC as
   standard.

   queue length.
 * Postfix Mail Server : The header_checks table for rejecting or redirecting

   other Webmin sessions, to prevent mismatches between forms and programs
   in the old and new versions.

   and access rights can now be derived from RBAC for selected users.
   This can be enabled on a per-user or per-module basic in the Webmin
   Users module.
 * Network Configuration : Interfaces used by Solaris zones are now recognized,
   and cannot be editing using this module (the Zones module must be

   on systems that have a large number of domains.
 * BIND DNS Server : More than one slave server to add new master zones
   to can now be defined, and zones will be added, deleted and applied
   on all at once. When a slave is added, existing master zones can also
   be converted to new slave zones on it.
 * BIND DNS Server : Multiple master, slave or forward zones can now
   be created at once from a batch file, using a new link on the module's
   index page.

   now be selected at once and deleted using a single button.
 * Printer Administration : Improved support for AIX, so that printer's
   enabled status can be properly shown and edited.

   properties for LDAP groups, similar to those for users.
 * IPFilter Firewall : The firewall configuration can now be copied automatically
   to multiple hosts in a cluster, and will be applied on all hosts when
   the the Apply button is clicked. Like other cluster features in Webmin,
   this requires that the servers be first setup in the Webmin Servers
   Index module.
 * IPFilter Firewall : Added the ability to view and edit NAT rules,
   so that you can setup masquerading and port redirection.
 * Read User Mail : Added a Module Config option (on by default) to get
   the From: address for users from Virtualmin, if installed.

   remote or local IP address.
 * Running Processes : Task IDs and zone names are now shown on Solaris,
   and processes can be viewed categorized by zone.

   be forced to select which Apache modules are installed - instead,
   this is detected automatically.
 * Apache Webserver : Added a Module Config option for specifying the
   filename template for new virtual server conf files, instead of always
   using DOMAINNAME.conf
 * Apache Webserver : When a virtual server in it's own private config
   file is deleted, the entire file will be removed to avoid leaving
   empty .conf files around.
 * Linux RAID : RAID devices can now be easily mounted as virtual memory.
 * Disk and Network Filesystems : The priority for swap files and devices
   can now be edited on Linux.

 * Webmin Core : Big Czech translation updates, thanks to Petr Vanek

   be changed on the DHCP Server access control page in the Webmin User's
   module.
